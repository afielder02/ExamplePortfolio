My passion for GIS grew from a love of the mountains, history, and the built environment. Growing up, I was fascinated by local history, especially since my high school was built on former prison grounds. This curiosity led me to uncover and document old photographs, sparking an interest in [film photography](https://afielder02.github.io/GISPortfolio/photos/) that has followed me to this day. Exploring historic aerial photographs of Salt Lake City deepened my fascination with urban development, transportation networks, and suburban sprawl. In college, I co-hosted a podcast about [public transportation](https://www.trlpod.com/), which led to travels and deeper engagement with local urbanism.

Now, as I prepare to graduate from Utah State University with a B.S. in Environmental Studies, a Certificate of Proficiency in GIS, and a Social Dimensions of Climate Change certificate, I look forward to applying my skills in an ecological or environmental field. While my focus has recently been more on ecology, I remain passionate about urban form and the built environment. Iâ€™m eager to connect with like-minded professionals to help shape more sustainable and livable communities.
