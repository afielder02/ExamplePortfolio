    <p>My name is Alex Fielder, and I just finished up my final semester at USU, graduating with a Bachelors of Science in Environmental Studies, and certificates of proficiency in Geographic Information Science and the Social Dimensions of Climate Change. I am currently working in USU's Riverscape Assessment and Monitoring Lab, and while Iâ€™m not currently seeking employment, I invite you to explore my portfolio and welcome you to reach out!</p>
