This page contains several reports I have created in classes and other projects.

<summary><b>500 North Bike Lane Proposal</b></summary>
<br>
This report was created in the "Communicating Sustainability" class and leverages Community-Based Social Marketing. The plan is currently under review by the city council and planning office, and several drafts of the bike lane have been drawn. A high-quality version can be found <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ttyRhSkwQyvXGtbFaPHlH321Z5Y45xSw/view?usp=sharing" target="_blank">here</a>.
