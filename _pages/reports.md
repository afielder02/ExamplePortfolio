This page contains several reports I have created in and outside of class.
<details>
<summary><b>500 North Bike Lane Proposal</b></summary>
<br>
This report was created in the "Communicating Sustainability" class and leverages Community-Based Social Marketing. The plan is currently under review by the city council and planning office, and several drafts of the bike lane have been drawn. A high-quality version can be found <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ttyRhSkwQyvXGtbFaPHlH321Z5Y45xSw/view?usp=sharing" target="_blank">here</a>.

<summary><b>Double Up Food Bucks</b></summary>
<br>
This was a project done outside of class regarding the Double Up Food Bucks Program. The idea was to figure out where and how far people are coming from to go to the farmers markets that had the double up program. The report goes over my methods of analysis and I created a supplemental story map (that I no longer have access to) <a href="https://storymaps.arcgis.com/stories/3acda68ada4c42d2bacafadd5dd1ed55" target="_blank">here</a>.
