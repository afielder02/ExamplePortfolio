My interest and passion in GIS naturally grew out of my love of the mountains and interest in history. Growing up, I was always fascinated about the built environment and the local history around me, especially with my high school being on the old prison grounds. This discovery led me down a long and winding journey finding out and documenting as much as I possibly could about the school through old photos. This led me into an interest of [film photography](https://afielder02.github.io/GISPortfolio/photos/) that has followed me since.

Learning more about the history of that school led me to discover the old aerial photographs of Salt Lake on the Utah Geological Survey website. These pictures, which I could look at for hours, led me to discover more about the Interurban Railways, Trolleys, Urban Form, and Suburban sprawl. It wasn’t until college that I began a podcast about public transportation with my college roommate and friend, which had led us on some trips and gotten us more involved in local urbanism. My discovered interest in Aerial Photography and Maps made me plan trips out to Fish Springs, Topaz Mountains, and beyond. Many of these trips did not happen after covid, but the plans are still there. 

Two years after transferring from the U of U to USU for the QCNR, I am looking forward to graduating with a Bachelors in Environmental Studies, a Certificate of Proficiency in GIS, and another certificate in the Social Dimensions of Climate Change. I am hoping to stay in an Ecological field with the work I’ve spent the last few years doing, but I still have a deep interest in urban form and the built environment. I look forward to connecting with like minded individuals to help create a better place to live.
