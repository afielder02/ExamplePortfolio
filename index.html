    <p>My name is Alex Fielder and I am in the last semester of my senior year at USU. I have spent the past couple years learning and perfecting my GIS abilities and am now looking for future opportunities to continue to grow my skills. Feel free to take a look at my previous works and projects in the portfolio tab.</p>
