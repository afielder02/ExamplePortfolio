    <p>My name is Alex Fielder, and I am finishing up my final semester at USU. Over the past few years, I have dedicated myself to developing and refining my GIS expertise, gaining hands-on experience in spatial analysis, data visualization, and geospatial technologies. I am now seeking opportunities to apply and further enhance my skills in a professional setting. I invite you to explore my portfolio, where youâ€™ll find a collection of my projects and past work showcasing my capabilities.</p>
